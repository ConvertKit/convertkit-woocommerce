[ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com) makes it easy to capture more leads and sell more products by easily
embedding email capture forms anywhere. This plugin makes it a little bit easier for those of us using WordPress
blogs, by automatically appending a lead capture form to any post or page.

3. Visit the settings page by clicking on the link under the plugin's name
4. Enter your ConvertKit API key, which you can find [here](https://app.convertkit.com/account/edit), and save the settings
5. Select your default form and save the settings
6. If you wish, choose particular forms for each post or page by visiting the edit screen and choosing the correct form
